# Rust State Machine for Embedded Autonomous Systems

This project implements a deterministic, test-driven state machine in Rust,
designed to model system behavior for safety-critical embedded and autonomous
applications.

The state machine explicitly represents operational modes, validates all state
transitions, and enforces fail-safe behavior. While initially hardware-agnostic,
the design mirrors real embedded control systems used in robotics, autonomous
vehicles, and mission-critical environments.
